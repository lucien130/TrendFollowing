# TrendFollowing
Trend-following trading strategy implemented with Backtrader
This repository provides a comprehensive trend-following trading strategy implemented in Python using Backtrader, designed to trade stocks such as AAPL, TTE, TSLA, and NVDA. The strategy employs a dynamic approach based on the crossover of a fast and slow moving average, complemented by advanced risk management techniques using ATR-based stop losses and dynamic trailing stops. It also incorporates momentum indicators like MACD and confirms signals with additional technical filters to improve entry and exit decisions while optimizing position sizing based on a fixed risk per trade. The framework is modular, including dedicated components for data acquisition via Yahoo Finance (with robust data formatting), strategy execution, performance analysis, visualization, and PDF report generation, making it a solid foundation for both academic research and practical quantitative trading development.
